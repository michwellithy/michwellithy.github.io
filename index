            <h2>Hello! This is my Design Portfolio</h2>
            <p>This site holds my design assignments as well as a little bit about myself. If you
                want to check out an assignment directly, click one of the images to your right.
                Click the 'Project' button above if you'd like to read a bit about each assignment
                first. Reading further on this page will allow you to see into the mind of the
                designer--me! </p>
            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>My name is Michelle Boychuk and I am working on my Master of Library and Information
                Studies degree at Dalhousie Uniersity in Halifax, NS. I am originally from Edmonton,
                AB with a background in English. </p>
            <p>I am mostly interested in the intersection between technology and information and how
                search is affected by a digital medium. I want to help people navigate this
                information-saturated world, and hopefully invent some innovative ways to search,
                and discover knowledge in the future. </p>
            <p>I'd also love to train service and police dogs, or build a self sustaining farming
                establishment. Librarianship called to me because of how varied the job prospects
                are; this varied life-style perfectly matches my compulsive learning style.</p>
