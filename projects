            <h2>Assignment 2: The Portfolio</h2><p>When creating websites, I tend to favour readability and ease-of use.
                I attemped to make my website intuitive by giving people multiple ways to access content. Thus, ensuring that users
                will make the right decision quickly regardless of which route they choose. A user
                can click on the 'projects' top navigation button or, if they read the bio first, then they will notice the quick links on
                the bottom right. The projects are the major draw of this site so it should be very
                easy to find them, though I did not want to go as far as putting them on the front
                page. </p>
            <p>I used images for links in an effort to cut down on the amount of text within the
                site and reduce cognitive load on the user. The ability to see my face while reading
                my biography helps facilitate compreension by making me seem more real and
                present.</p>
            <p>Link colours are chosen so that they are a brighter, more eyecaching colour when
                unvisited. Once clicked, they fade out to a darker red, so that visited pages will
                not be as distracting.</p>
            <p>In terms of readability, I chose a strong title font and made the titles heirarchical
                through sizing--the major titles are larger and the less important titles are
                smaller. The content font is a clear serif font that guides the eye to the end of
                the shortened line easily. My writing does not contain long, drawn out sentences.
                Nor does it contain words that would be difficult for people to understand.
                The paragraphs are broken into digestible bites by subject. Line breaks indicate
                new pargraphs with white space. All textual content is left-justified to match the majority of users' reading
                styles. </p>
            <p>The site is responsive in terms of screen sizes and mediums. If one so chooses to
                print this website all the unceccessary links and ink-heavy images have been
                removed leaving simply the impotant textual content. If on a smaller screen, such as
                a tablet or smartphone, the layout squishes and reorganizes so that the structure is
                vertically oriented. All element sizes are relative, even the images, so they
                resize with the browser window. </p>

                <a href="assignments/assignment.pdf">Assignment 3: Website Evaluation
                Report</a></h2>
            <p>In this project I will choose a website and create a report that evaluates its
                effectiveness based on its use of the principles of design and the standards of web
                development and content creation we have discussed in the class.</p></div>

                <a href="assignments/assignment.pdf">Assignment 5: XML Project</a></h2><p>This
                project will give me experience in planning and carrying out a mark up project
                beginning with an examination of a scanned and OCR'd copy of a physical document
                from the Dalhousie Archives and working through the development of a strategy for
                marking up the document using TEI XML, and finally for transforming and presenting
                the document.</p>

                <a href="assignments/assignment.pdf">Assignment 4: TEI XML Project</a></h2><p>For
                this project I will create your own xml document: either a database-type document or
                a text-type document, each of which have specific requirements.</p>
